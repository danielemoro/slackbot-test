Hello Goldwater Scholar!

As the Goldwater Scholar Community (GSC) on Slack continues to grow and we begin to lay the framework for the future, we feel that it is important to get regular input from a small collection of committed Scholars from diverse backgrounds on what the GSC can provide for you. *For this reason, we are forming the GSC Council*, a team that will generate, initiate, and execute ideas to improve the community. If interested, please fill out the form in the following link: http://bit.ly/GSC_Council

Thank you for being a part of the GSC!
